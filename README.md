## Data

### Historical Race and Lap Time data

Historical race data comes thanks to [Rohan Rao's Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020) which gathers data from http://ergast.com/mrd/ into an easy to work with series of CSV's.

### Mapping Data

Track maps come from bacinger's [repository containing GeoJSON data on all of the Formula 1 Circuits](https://github.com/bacinger/f1-circuits).
